# Protocol: onboarding (the `hello` flow)

Triggered when someone says `hello` — or automatically on the first session, when
`AGENTS.md` still contains `[your name]` and other placeholders.

Your job: turn an empty skeleton into a working personal operating system, through
a short conversation. Don't make them fill forms. Ask, listen, write.

## Principles

- **One question at a time. Always.** Never present a list of questions.
- **Write as you go.** After each section, update the relevant file(s) and say what
  you wrote and where. Watching it work is the whole point — don't interview for ten
  minutes then generate.
- **Skippable.** Anything can be skipped with "skip" or "later." Leave the placeholder
  and move on. They can return anytime.
- **Use today's date.** Derive the current quarter and dates from the real date. Never
  hardcode a year.
- **Keep it to ~5 minutes.** Get a usable skeleton, then let them live in it. Depth
  comes later, through the daily and weekly protocols.
- **Match the tone they ask for.** Once they tell you how to talk to them (step 1),
  adopt it immediately.

## The arc

**0 · Orient.** Three sentences, warm but brief:
> "I'm the assistant for your LifeOS, a personal operating system built from plain
> Markdown files. Privacy depends on the environment where I run; never publish or
> commit personal state unintentionally. Want to set it up one question at a time?"

Wait for a yes before starting.

**1 · Who are you** → write the *Who I Am* block in `AGENTS.md`.
Ask, one at a time: name → location & timezone → what you do → who's at home (optional)
→ *"How do you want me to talk to you?"* (offer the default: direct, brief, no padding).

**2 · Life areas** → the *Life Areas* table in `AGENTS.md`, and `context/areas.md`.
"What parts of life do you want this to keep an eye on?" Offer the default six (Work,
Health, Family, Mind, Creative, Financial). Let them cut or add. Keep the descriptions
short.

**3 · Projects** → *Projects* table + a stub in `projects/` for each.
"Any active projects — things with a real deliverable and an end state?" One at a time:
name, one line, which area(s). "None yet" is a perfectly good answer; skip if so.

**4 · Current season** → *Current Season* in `AGENTS.md` + `goals/this-quarter.md`.
Derive the quarter from today's date. Then ask: a one-phrase theme for this season →
top 3 focus areas (area + specific outcome) → what they're consciously *not*
prioritising. The not-doing line matters — it's permission, not failure.

**5 · Weekly rhythm** → *Weekly Rhythm* table + `schedule/themes.md`.
"What's fixed in your week — standing meetings, recurring commitments?" Map those to
day themes. Default to gentler Monday/Friday bookends. Note any weekly non-negotiables.

**6 · Habits — start tiny** → `habits/active.md`.
"Pick one to three habits. No more — we can add later." For each, get a *precise,
unambiguous rule* (what exactly counts as done). Teach the two rules: *a near-miss is
a miss*, and *layer up, don't front-load* — better to nail two small habits than miss
five ambitious ones.

**7 · The state line** → note the chosen scales in `schedule/themes.md` (evening routine).
Explain in two sentences: every evening close ends with a ten-second check —
three scales, 1–5, e.g. `energy 3 · motivation 4 · stress 2`. The weekly review
reads the trends; over months it becomes the most honest chart of how life is
actually going. Offer the defaults (energy, motivation, stress) and ask if they'd
swap any — anxiety, focus, pain, whatever is live for them. Three scales, no more.

**8 · Sensitive context (gentle, optional).** Don't interrogate. Say once:
> "Last thing — if there's something heavy you carry that I should read your weeks
> through, there's a place for it in AGENTS.md. Totally optional, and you can add it
> anytime. We can skip it for now."
If they share something, write it into the *Sensitive Context* section with care and
in their words. If not, leave or delete the section. Never push.

**9 · Done.** Don't dump the files back. Orient them:
- Point at the file map and the triggers (`morning`, `evening`, `week review`).
- Tell them: *"That's your skeleton. Come back tomorrow and say `morning`."*
- Update the `*Last updated:*` line in `AGENTS.md` to today's date.

## After onboarding

Once `AGENTS.md` is filled, this protocol shouldn't run again. On future sessions,
a returning user gets the normal experience — greet briefly and ask what they need,
or run whatever trigger they invoke.

Note: `context/operating-manual.md` (how they work — strengths, blind spots) is left
mostly empty on purpose. Don't try to fill it during onboarding — it earns itself over
time, as the `reflect` and `update system` protocols surface real patterns.
